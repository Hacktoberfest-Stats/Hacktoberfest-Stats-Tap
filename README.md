# GitHub Hacktoberfest Stats "Tap"

> Not for code contributions - the source code is remote.

Orchestrate ETL and data processing pipeline for Hacktoberfest GitHub PR statistical analysis:
* Regularly between `YYYY-09-30-10:00:00` and `YYYY-11-01-14:00:00` UTC for 
  * valid PRs merged to repos
  * accepted valid PRs not merged to repos
* Valid PRs are
  * to repositories with the `hacktoberfest` topic or have the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label, and 
  * created between `YYYY-09-30-10:00:00` and `YYYY-11-01-14:00:00` UTC, and
  * not be labelled either `spam` or `invalid` if not labelled `hacktoberfest-accepted`, and
  * not a draft PR
* Accepted PRs must be valid and, between `YYYY-09-30-10:00:00` and `YYYY-11-01-14:00:00` UTC, either
  * merged, or
  * open and labelled with `hacktoberfest-accepted`
* Excludes PR review acceptance criteria on assumption of being merged if all code owners approve
* Does not account for PR disqualification aside for PR labels `spam` and `invalid`
* Assumes included repositories meet other requirements to be valid for hacktoberfest
  * includes fork repos, owned by PR creators or not, assuming they meet acceptance criteria
  * accepted PR data for repos removed following API-fetching day(s) will be included in the stats 

## Instructions

* For `i` in `{1,...,4}`, create a [repository Action](../../settings/secrets/actions/new) named `GH_TOKEN_<i>` using a unique [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new) with:
  * `Public repositories`
  * _note: `i` must match the job matrix in `.github/workflows/sync_parallel_step.yml`_
* Create a [repository Action](../../settings/secrets/actions/new) named `REPO_NAME` using the `<owner/repository>` name the source code is hosted in.
* Create a [repository Action](../../settings/secrets/actions/new) named `REPO_TOKEN` using a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new) with:
  * the `Resource owner` matching the `owner` in the `<owner/repository>` name set to the `REPO_NAME` action
  * `Only select repositories`:
    * the repository matching the `<owner/repository>` name set to `REPO_NAME`
  * `Add permissions`:
    * `Contents`:

* Create a [repository Action](../../settings/secrets/actions/new) named `KEY` using a base64-encoded random key ðŸ”‘:
    ```python
    base64.urlsafe_b64encode(key=os.urandom(32)).decode()
    ```
